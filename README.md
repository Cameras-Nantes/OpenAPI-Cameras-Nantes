# OpenAPI-Cameras-Nantes

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.

I have replaced [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) with [Angular](https://angular.io/), which is completely new and has almost nothing to see with AngularJS. 

My application is still [available here](openapi-cameras-nantes.firebaseapp.com).

## Use locally

``` bash
npm install

#Start server
npm start
```
